This repository is primarily my personal collection of utility functions, classes, and code snippets,
universally useful for general C/C++ programming. I am targeting portable additions to standard libraries,
extensions that are dearly missed from the standard(s), and added functional layers for large popular
suites such as Qt. This part is collectively known as SKLib.

Secondly, over the past years I developed couple of software applications (using SKLib) that deserve
public exposure.

Third, there are some stray works unrelated to SKLib, that are still worth publishing.

All C++ programs are currently targeting C++14, MS Visual Sudio 2019 or later, GCC 6.x or later.
