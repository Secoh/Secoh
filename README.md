This page is primarily my personal collection of utility functions, classes, and code snippets,
universally useful for general C/C++ programming. I am targeting portable additions to standard libraries,
extensions that are dearly missed from the standard(s), or that are adding functional layers for large
popular suites such as Qt. This part is collectively known as SKLib.

Secondly, over the past years I developed couple of software applications (using SKLib) that deserve
public exposure.

Third, there are some stray works unrelated to SKLib, that are still worth publishing.

All C++ programs are currently targeting C++14, MS Visual Sudio 2019 or later, GCC 6.x or later.
The target platforms are x86/x64 Windows, x64 Linux, Raspberry Pi Linux, and, where applicable,
Atmel Studio 7+ and SAM microcontrollers.
Other platforms *may* be supported in the view of general C/C++ portability.

About myself: Secoh is a water dragon and the citizen of the Reef Republic (not to be mistaken with
Earth things with same name). I was given the name after one of the heroes of the Fight for the Tower,
but I am not related to him. I am visiting Earth as a member of research expedition studying, in your
words, extraterrestrial life. We reside in area of Pacific in undisclosed location.
P.S. I want to keep my IRL counterpart private.
